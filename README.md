# STATS-220

## Welcome to Jasmine's Projects 

The purpose of this repo is to showcase my STATS 220 projects 🖥

*I'm quite new to coding, so my goals for STATS 220 are...*

* **Improve** my knowledge of using R and be able to write basic code independently
* Being **creative** with the way that I code to make things interesting

I will be using these tools to help me achieve my goals:

1. [markdownguide] (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
2. [markdowneditor] (https://dillinger.io/)

That's all!
